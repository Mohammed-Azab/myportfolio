    description:
      "TriFlameX is a swarm of three autonomous fire‑fighting robots that collaboratively detect, locate, and suppress small‑scale fires in indoor or controlled outdoor environments.",
    longDescription:
      "Each robot combines mobility, real‑time sensing, wireless communication, and on‑board decision‑making.\n\nCommunication (📡):\n• UART for intra‑car data transfer\n• MQTT over Wi‑Fi for inter‑device communication\n\nSystem Architecture (three‑layer):\nI. Laptop (Central Controller) 💻 – Runs high‑level Python algorithms, communicates with ESP32 via MQTT/Wi‑Fi, integrates ROS2 for manual control using the /joy topic.\nII. ESP32 (Communication Hub) 📡 – Reads ToF sensor data via UART1 and publishes/subscribes via MQTT (C++); forwards commands to STM32 over UART2 using a custom 6‑byte binary protocol.\nIII. STM32 (Low‑Level Controller) ⚙️ – Validates and executes commands; controls motors/servos using PWM and PD control with safety checks (Embedded C, bare‑metal).\n\nKey Technical Highlights (🔧):\n• Custom real‑time GUI for data visualization.\n• Custom Thermal LiDAR built from ToF sensor + stepper motor + flame sensor.\n• ‘Azab Protocol’: a fast, reliable, lightweight 6‑byte binary protocol using interrupts + FreeRTOS at 500k baud for ESP32↔STM32 communication.",
