    description:
      "Swarm of three autonomous robots that cooperatively detect, localize, and suppress small fires.",
    longDescription:
      "Overview\nTriFlameX is a swarm of three robots that work together to find and suppress small fires in indoor or controlled outdoor spaces. Each robot combines mobility, real‑time sensing, wireless communication, and on‑board decision making.\n\nCommunication\n- UART for intra‑car data transfer\n- MQTT over Wi‑Fi for inter‑device messaging\n\nSystem architecture (three layers)\n1) Laptop (central controller): runs Python algorithms, talks to ESP32 via MQTT/Wi‑Fi, integrates ROS2 for manual control using the /joy topic.\n2) ESP32 (communication hub): reads ToF sensor data over UART1, uses MQTT (C++), forwards commands to STM32 over UART2 using a custom 6‑byte binary protocol.\n3) STM32 (low‑level controller): validates and executes commands; controls motors and servos using PWM and PD control with safety checks (Embedded C, bare metal).",
